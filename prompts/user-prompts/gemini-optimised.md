# Baby Monitoring System Project - AI and Technical Guidance Request

## 1. Project Overview & Personal Context

This project involves setting up a home IP camera monitoring system for my newborn son. The primary motivation is ensuring my son's welfare, which is extremely important to me as a new parent. While I am interested in learning about AI aspects, my immediate goal is to establish a functional and useful system relatively soon. The system should also be extensible for future needs.

## 2. Project Genesis & Motivation

*   **Trigger Event:** The project was initiated after a concerning incident where our son slept remarkably still during the night. This event shifted our perspective from viewing monitors as intrusive to recognizing their significant value for peace of mind.
*   **Core Concerns:
    *   **SIDS / Non-Breathing Events:** Detecting the absence of movement in a sleeping infant.
    *   **Crying Detection:** Alerting to audible distress.
*   **Personal Use Case:** I work from home and find it essential to check on my son during the night. My wife also uses the system for reassurance when she's working.

## 3. Existing Setup & Hardware

*   **Cameras:**
    *   Reolink E1 Pro (highly praised for excellent infrared performance, even in complete darkness).
    *   TP-Link cameras (less reliable than Reolink).
    *   All cameras are IP cameras connected via Wi-Fi due to the inability to run wired internet throughout the house.
*   **Home Server:**
    *   Retired desktop computer.
    *   CPU: Intel i3.
    *   GPU: NVIDIA 1050.
    *   Virtual Machine (VM) created specifically for this project with GPU passthrough enabled.
*   **Software & Connectivity:**
    *   RTSP streams are accessed locally on the network.
    *   Preference for web-based interfaces over desktop applications for accessibility on mobile (Android).
    *   Currently, system usage is largely manual.

## 4. Key Challenges & Desired AI Features

*   **Digital Zoom Requirement:** Non-PTZ cameras require significant digital zoom to see details of my son's state. The current Reolink resolution is adequate for this.
*   **'Lack of Motion' Detection:** This is a critical and challenging area. Standard IP camera motion detection focuses on *presence* of motion, not its absence (required for SIDS monitoring). This necessitates careful tuning of detection zones, timeframes, and sensitivity to minimize false positives.
*   **AI-Driven State & Presence Detection:**
    *   **Presence Tracking:** Identifying my son's location across multiple cameras and triggering a boolean state (e.g., "David in Crib").
    *   **Distinguishing Individuals:** Differentiating my son (baby) from adults (parents) â€“ this appears to require facial recognition or advanced body pose estimation.
    *   **Activity State:** Detecting if my son is asleep, awake, fidgeting, or inactive.
*   **Auto-Tracking Enhancement:**
    *   Frigate's auto-tracking is limited to PTZ cameras.
    *   **Desired Feature:** Auto-cropping and zooming into the closest face of a detected person (even via digital zoom) would improve motion detection reliability and provide quick, focused visual checks.
*   **Hardware Acceleration Issues:** Attempts to enable GPU acceleration (with TensorRT, NVIDIA container runtime) on the current server resulted in very low GPU usage (1%) and high CPU usage (80-90%) for object detection. Adding features like zoning significantly strains the hardware.

## 5. Explored Software & Potential Solutions

*   **Attempted Software:** Frigate, Scripted, Home Assistant integrations, ZoneMinder, Agent DVR.
*   **Frigate Limitations:** While a good system, its default parameters are too demanding for the current hardware. 
*   **Approach 1 (Customization):** Build a system using specific components:
    *   **'Lack of Motion' Detection:** Monitor time since last motion and detection levels.
    *   **Person State Detection:** Define states like asleep, awake, fidgeting.
    *   **Cry Detection:** Integrate audio recognition models.
    *   **Output:** Alerting via MQTT, integrated into Home Assistant.
*   **Approach 2 (Dedicated Solution):** Find a cloud-hosted or locally deployable project specifically designed for baby monitoring use cases.
*   **General Observation:** RTSP and HLS are common camera outputs, while specific AI libraries for 'wake/sleep/recognition' might need custom creation or training.

## 6. Hardware Considerations & Preferences

*   **Local Purchase Preferred:** Component availability in Israel is a factor (e.g., Google Coral is unavailable; Helio TPUs are an option).
*   **Hardware Goal:** A bare-metal, dedicated box for the NVR task. Avoids over/under-provisioning.
*   **Desired Hardware Specs:** A speedy CPU and a decent GPU capable of accelerating AI workloads.
*   **Budget:** Willing to invest in new hardware but seeking cost-effective options and clarity on what's needed.

## 7. Alerting & Integration Requirements

*   **MQTT:** Desired for alerts, integrating with Home Assistant.
*   **Home Assistant:** Needs to receive alerts and potentially automatically cropped frames.
*   **Alert Delivery:** Explore options like smartwatches, smart bracelets, or home alarms for critical alerts.
*   **Specific Alerts:** "David is in this bed," "David has left this bed."
*   **Automated Cropping:** Crucial for simplifying quick visual checks.
*   **Camera Focus:** Display only the camera showing my son when he's not under direct observation.

## 8. Request for Guidance

I am seeking detailed thoughts on the best way forward, considering the following:

1.  **Overall Strategy:** What is the most effective approach to achieve the desired monitoring and AI capabilities?
2.  **Software Approach:** Is it feasible and advisable to customize Frigate by layering custom components for specific alerting (MQTT) and integrating these with Home Assistant (including auto-cropped frames)?
3.  **Hardware Recommendations:**
    *   What specific hardware (CPU, GPU, potentially TPUs like Helio) would be suitable for this workload?
    *   Contextualize recommendations based on component availability in Israel (local stores like Ivory and KSP).
    *   Provide pros and cons for different hardware implementations and estimated price ranges.
4.  **AI Model Implementation:**
    *   How can 'lack of motion' detection be effectively implemented?
    *   How to approach state detection (asleep, awake, fidgeting) and cry detection?
    *   Should I consider custom model training or fine-tuning?
5.  **Alerting Mechanisms:**
    *   How can alerts be configured for smartwatches, bracelets, or home alarms?
    *   Provide a full walkthrough of how alerting could work, especially for emergency scenarios.

I'm willing to put in the effort to get a system that works exceptionally well for this critical use case.
